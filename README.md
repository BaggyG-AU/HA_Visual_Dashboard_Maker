# Home Assistant Visual Dashboard Editor

A cross-platform desktop application for visually designing Home Assistant dashboards with drag-and-drop functionality and support for popular custom cards.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Requirements & Architecture Planning

This project is in early development. See [REQUIREMENTS_QUESTIONNAIRE.md](REQUIREMENTS_QUESTIONNAIRE.md) for detailed requirements gathering and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical architecture.

## Vision

Create a professional WYSIWYG editor for Home Assistant dashboards that:
- Connects to Home Assistant instances to read and write dashboard configurations
- Provides intuitive drag-and-drop visual editing
- Supports popular custom cards (bubble-card, apexcharts-card, button-card, card-mod)
- Works on Windows and Linux
- Offers both visual and code (YAML) editing modes

## Planned Features

### Core Features (MVP)
- Load and parse Home Assistant dashboard YAML files
- Visual canvas with drag-and-drop card positioning
- Property editors for standard HA cards
- Split view: Visual editor + YAML code editor
- Save dashboard configurations to YAML files
- Basic validation and error checking

### Custom Card Support
- Bubble Card: Minimalist card collection with pop-up interfaces
- ApexCharts Card: Advanced data visualization and graphs
- Button Card: Highly customizable button cards
- Card-mod: CSS styling layer for all cards

### Advanced Features (Future)
- Direct Home Assistant connection via WebSocket API
- Live entity state preview
- Entity browser and autocomplete
- Dashboard templates and sharing
- Undo/redo functionality
- Real-time collaboration features
