# Keyboard Shortcuts

This app supports keyboard shortcuts for common editor actions.

## Editor Shortcuts

These shortcuts are active when focus is **not** inside a text input/textarea/contenteditable element.

- `Ctrl+S` — Save dashboard
- `Ctrl+Z` — Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` — Redo
- `Ctrl+C` — Copy selected card
- `Ctrl+X` — Cut selected card
- `Ctrl+V` — Paste card
- `Delete` — Delete selected card

## Color Picker Shortcuts

When a Color Picker popover is open in the Properties Panel:

- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` — Move focus through controls
- `Enter` — Confirm a typed color value in the color input (commits validation)
- `Escape` — Dismiss the popover
